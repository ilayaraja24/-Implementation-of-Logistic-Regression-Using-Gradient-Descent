# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Use the standard libraries in python for finding linear regression.
2. Set variables for assigning dataset values.
3. Import linear regression from sklearn.
4. Predict the values of array.
5. Calculate the accuracy, confusion and classification report by importing the required modules from sklearn.
6. Obtain the graph.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.
Developed by: ILAYARAJA.M
RegisterNumber: 212221040057
*/
```

## Output:
![logistic regression using gradient descent](sam.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent is written and verified using python programming.
